Stop copying-and-pasting your code and figures between X^[Insert your programming environment here] and Y^[Insert your office software here]!

You can use many tools to combine text and code and create beautiful documents.

You can use your code and figures in presentations, webpages, blog posts, and webapps.

You can write reports, prepare manuscripts and respond to reviewers.

You can even meme with your code !

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(magick)

yes_img <- "images/yes.png"
no_img <- "images/no.png"

yes_plot <- ggdraw() + draw_image(yes_img, scale = 1)
no_plot <- ggdraw() + draw_image(no_img, scale = 1)

bad_plot <- 
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = "blue")) +
  geom_point()

good_plot <- 
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(colour = "red") + 
  theme_half_open(12) +
  labs(x = "Engine power (litres displ.)",
       y = "Fuel Efficiency (miles/gallon)")


plot_grid(yes_plot, good_plot,
          no_plot, bad_plot) 
```


## Markdown

Markdown combines both the clear reading experience from word processor documents with the benefits of software code documents, which is both versatile and easy to useâ€”even for people that only know how to operate Word or Writer.

At first, Markdown was basically a small script [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) wrote for himself in 2004 to yield these benefits. 

In 2012 a group of developers form [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/) to standardise Markdown into an internationally accepted norm.

## R Markdown

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Weave together narrative text written in markdown with executable code to produce elegantly formatted output.

You can create "Notebooks" that include chunks of code that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.

Or you can use Rmarkdown to render a final document showing code and/or outputs in different formats. 

You can use [multiple languages](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html) besides R: from `awk` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) to `groovy` (https://groovy-lang.org/) and including `python`, and `sql`.

## Jupyter 

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) develops open-source software, open standards, and services for interactive computing across multiple programming languages. 

Jupyter supports execution environments (called "kernels") in several dozen languages, including Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and Python. 

## Quarto

An open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto can use Jupyter notebooks or plain text markdown to create dynamic content or reproducible documents.

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
